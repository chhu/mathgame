# Multiply trainer for kids
Single-page html math multiplication trainer for kids. No backend required. Page uses browser storage to store results, mainly to distribute "stars" if the kid managed to beat its own time for the same number pair. The foundation was made using Ollama Mixtral LLM from the prompt.txt file. Scoring has a time factor, negative answers lead to loss of points.

May get extended to simple division or even just plus / minus, depending on feedback.

Oh and the few words it uses are in German.
